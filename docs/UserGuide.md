## 5.1. Basic commands

The commands in this section are the basic commands used to manipulate food items.

### 5.1.1. Adding a food item: `add`
_(Contributed by Jonah Tan)_

The `add` command stores a food item in your food inventory, so that you can start tracking it.
You can then access the food item later on for editing, deleting etc.

**Format:** `add d/DESCRIPTION e/EXPIRY_DATE q/QUANTITY [p/PRIORITY] [t/TAG]...`

* Duplicates cannot be added to the food inventory. (Please head to the [glossary](#8-glossary) for an explanation for duplicate food items.)
* The description and tag can contain a maximum of 50 and 30 characters respectively, including whitespaces.
* The expiry date must be in the format of `DD-MM-YYYY` or `DD/MM/YYYY`.
* The quantity consists of 2 entities - `value` and `unit`. The `value` should come before the `unit`.
  * The `value` is compulsory. The maximum value allowed is 100,000.00.
  * The `unit` is optional. If not provided, the default unit - `unit` - will be given.
* The priority parameter is case insensitive, and can either be `high`, `medium` or `low` and is optional. If a priority is not specified, the default priority will be set to `LOW`.
* A food item can have any number of tags (including 0).
  * If multiple of the same tags are entered, only the first tag will be added (i.e For `t/Frozen t/frozen t/FROZEN`, only `Frozen` will be added to the food item).
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Examples:**
* `add d/Canned tuna e/1-1-2021 q/1.5 can p/low` adds an item having description `Canned tuna`, expiry date `01-01-2021`, quantity `1.50 can` and priority `LOW`.
* `add d/Banana pie e/20-11-2020 q/2 p/medium t/$15 t/contains nuts` adds an item having description `Banana pie`, expiry date `20-11-2020`, quantity `2.00 unit`, priority `MEDIUM`, and tags `$15` and `contains nuts`.

Steps:
1. Type `add d/Banana pie e/20-11-2020 q/2 p/medium t/$15 t/contains nuts` in the _Command Box_.
2. Press `Enter` to execute.

Before the `add` command is executed:

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.1.2. Editing a food item: `edit`
_(Contributed by Roland Yu)_

The `edit` command edits the details of an existing food item in your food inventory.
If an entry is incorrect, you can easily edit the entry without deleting and re-adding the food item.

**Format:** `edit INDEX [d/DESCRIPTION] [e/EXPIRY_DATE] [q/QUANTITY] [p/PRIORITY] [t/TAG]...`

* It edits the food item at the specified `INDEX`.
  * The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed food list.
  * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …
* Existing values will be replaced with the values you input.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the food item will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
  * You can remove all the tags of a food item by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* You cannot edit a food item into a duplicate. (Please head to the [glossary](#8-glossary) for an explanation for duplicate food items.)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note about the parameters:**<br>

The constraints for the individual parameters of this command (description, expiry date, quantity, priority and tags) are the same as those for the [`add`](#511-adding-a-food-item-add) command.

</div>

**Examples:**
* `edit 1 d/baked beans e/1-1-2020` edits the food description and expiry date of the 1st food item to be `baked beans` and `01-01-2020` respectively.
* `edit 2 d/canned tuna q/0.5 can t/` edits the food description of the 2nd food item to be `canned tuna`, quantity to `0.50 can` and clears all existing tags.

Steps:
1. Type `edit 2 p/high e/25-11-2020` in the _Command Box_.
2. Press `Enter` to execute.

<p style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline">Figure 8: Shows the food item after being edited.</p>

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.1.3. Deleting a food item: `delete`

_(Contributed by Ang Song Yi and Boh Cheng Hin)_

The `delete` command deletes a specified food item from your food inventory, so that you can stop tracking it.

**Format:** `delete INDEX`

* It deletes the food item at the specified `INDEX`.
  * The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed food list.
  * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …

**Examples:**
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd food item in your food inventory.
* `find d/tuna` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st food item from the result of the `find` command.

Steps:
1. Type `delete 2` in the _Command Box_.
2. Press `Enter` to execute.

Before the `delete` command is executed:

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### 5.1.4. Changing the quantity of a food item: `changeqty`

_(Contributed by Ang Song Yi)_

The `changeqty` command changes the quantity of an existing food item in your food inventory without you having to calculate it yourself.
Use this command if you have bought new food items or used/discarded some existing food items.

**Format:** `changeqty INDEX a/AMOUNT`

* It changes the quantity of the food item at the specified `INDEX`.
  * The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed food list.
  * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …
* The amount is the quantity of a food item you want to change by.
  * The amount is a non-zero signed number with a maximum of 2 decimal places. It should be more than -100,000.00 and less than +100,000.00, but not 0.
  * Indicate a positive or negative sign before the value to show increment or decrement respectively.
* Do not specify the unit of the food item. The existing unit will be used instead.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Constraint on the size of amount:**<br>

Choose an amount such that the **final** quantity of the food item is not less than or equal to 0, or more than 100,000.00.

For example, you have already added 50,000.00 grams of flour in your food inventory with the [`add`](#511-adding-a-food-item-add) command.
You can use the `changeqty` command to add 0.01 to 50,000.00 grams of flour or subtract 0.01 to 49,999.99 grams of flour.
If you have used up all the flour, use the [`delete`](#513-deleting-a-food-item-delete) command instead.

</div>

**Examples:**
* `list` followed by `changeqty 1 a/+1` increases the quantity of the 1st food item in your food inventory by 1.
* `find d/tuna` followed by `changeqty 2 a/-2.50` decreases the quantity of the 2nd food item from the result of the `find` command by 2.50.

Steps:
1. Type `changeqty 3 a/-0.5` in the _Command Box_.
2. Press `Enter` to execute.

Before the `changeqty` command is executed:

![Before executing the changeqty command](images/ChangeqtyCommandBefore.png)

<p style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline">Figure 11: Shows the food item's quantity to be changed.</p>

## 5.2. Sorting commands
_(Contributed by Roland Yu)_

The commands in this section can be used to sort the food list. The sorting order will remain when restarting the application. 

Before the list of food items is sorted for the first time, it will be ordered by `description` by default. 

Refer to the [Sorting food items by description`](#521-sorting-food-items-by-description-sortdesc) section for a detailed explanation of sorting by description.

### 5.2.1. Sorting food items by description: `sortdesc`
_(Contributed by Roland Yu)_

The `sortdesc` command sorts the list of food items by description, allowing you to view your food items by description.

**Format:** `sortdesc`

* Sorting by description consists of 2 steps:
    * Firstly, the list is sorted in lexicographical order and is case insensitive to the descriptions' first characters.
    * Next, if the first characters of two food items' descriptions are the same letters (e.g. `apple` and `Acorn`), descriptions with upper case first characters will be ordered lower compared to descriptions with lower case first characters (i.e. `Acorn` will be ordered below `apple`).
* Food items of the same description will be sorted by expiry date from oldest to newest.
* Food items of the same description and same expiry date will be sorted by priority from high to low.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Steps:
1. Type `sortdesc` in the _Command Box_.
2. Press `Enter` to execute.

Before the `sortdesc` command is executed:

![Before executing the sortdesc command](images/SortdescCommandBefore.png)

<p style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline">Figure 13: The red box shows the sort by description command being typed into the command box.</p>

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.2.2. Sorting food items by expiry date: `sortexpiry`
_(Contributed by Roland Yu)_

The `sortexpiry` command sorts the list of food items by expiry date from oldest to newest. With this, you can easily tell which food items are expiring first.

**Format:** `sortexpiry`

* Food items of the same expiry date will be sorted by priority from high to low.
* Food items of the same expiry date and same priority will be sorted by description.

Steps:
1. Type `sortexpiry` in the _Command Box_.
2. Press `Enter` to execute.

Before the `sortexpiry` command is executed:

![Before executing the sortexpiry command](images/SortexpiryCommandBefore.png)

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.2.3. Sorting food items by priority: `sortpriority`
_(Contributed by Roland Yu)_

The `sortpriority` command sorts the list of food items by priority from high to low. With this, you can easily tell which food items have higher priorities.

**Format:** `sortpriority`

* Food items of the same priority will be sorted by expiry date from oldest to newest.
* Food items of the same priority and same expiry date will be sorted by description.

Steps:
1. Type `sortpriority` in the _Command Box_.
2. Press `Enter` to execute.

Before the `sortpriority` command is executed:

## 5.3. Viewing commands

The commands in this section are used when navigating food item information on the application.

### 5.3.1. Listing all food items: `list`

The `list` command shows the complete list of food items in your food inventory.
This command is suitable if you want to get a glimpse of all your food items currently in your kitchen.

**Format:** `list`

Steps:
1. Type `list` in the _Command Box_.
2. Press `Enter` to execute.

Before the `list` command is executed:

<p style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline">Figure 20: Shows food list with all food items listed.</p>

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### 5.3.2. Finding food items: `find`
_(Contributed by Jonah Tan and Boh Cheng Hin)_

The `find` command searches for food items in your food inventory that match the search query and displays the result on your food list. You can easily find a specific food item, or a group of food items.

**Format:** `find [d/DESCRIPTION [MORE_DESCRIPTIONS]...] [e/EXPIRY DATE] [p/PRIORITY] [t/TAG]...`

* The search is case-insensitive (e.g `fish` will match `Fish`).
* Only full words in description will be matched (e.g. `fis` will not match `fish`).
* Food items with description matching at least one keyword (i.e `OR` search) will be returned (e.g. `fish` will return `Fish Cake`, `Tuna Fish`).
* Only full tags will be matched e.g. `nuts` will not match `contains nuts`.
* Food items with tags matching at least one of the search tags (i.e `OR` search) will be returned (e.g. `frozen` will return all food items with tags `frozen` regardless of their other tags).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note about the parameters:**<br>

The constraints for the individual parameters of this command (each description in the descriptions parameter, expiry date, quantity, priority and tags) are the same as those for the [`add`](#511-adding-a-food-item-add) command.

</div>

**Examples:**
* `find d/apple tuna` can return `Apple Pie` and `Tuna Can`.
* `find e/30-12-2020` returns all food items with expiry date on `30-12-2020`.
* `find d/apple p/high` can return `Apple Pie` and `Apple Jam` if both items have a `HIGH` priority.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
* `find t/cat t/dog` returns all food items with the tag `cat` or `dog`.
* `find d/biscuits p/medium e/30-12-2020 t/cat t/dog` returns food items with `biscuits` in their descriptions, `MEDIUM` priorities, expiry dates of `30-12-2020` and have either `cat` or `dog` as tags.

Steps:
1. Type `find e/1-11-2021` in the _Command Box_.
2. Press `Enter` to execute.

Before the `find` command is executed:

### 5.3.3. Viewing expired food items: `expired`

_(Contributed by Ang Song Yi and Jonah Tan)_

When you launch the application, it checks for any expired food items present in your food inventory. This lets you easily see what food items have expired.
If there are any expired food items, a pop-up window similar to the one shown in Figure 23 will appear with the list of expired food item(s).
If you want to see the pop-up window while using the application, you can use the `expired` command.

**Format:** `expired`

Steps:
1. Type `expired` in the _Command Box_.
2. Press `Enter` to execute.

Before the `expired` command is executed:

## 5.4. Miscellaneous commands

These are additional commands you can use to enhance your experience with SimplyKitchen.

### 5.4.1. Undoing previous command: `undo`
_(Contributed by Boh Cheng Hin)_

The `undo` command restores your food inventory to a state before an undoable command was executed. This lets you easily correct mistakes made on your food inventory.
Undoable commands are commands that modify your food inventory's content ([`add`](#511-adding-a-food-item-add), [`edit`](#512-editing-a-food-item-edit), [`delete`](#513-deleting-a-food-item-delete) , [`changeqty`](#514-changing-the-quantity-of-a-food-item-changeqty) and [`clear`](#543-clearing-all-entries-clear)) and commands that sort food items ([`sortdesc`](#521-sorting-food-items-by-description-sortdesc), [`sortexpiry`](#522-sorting-food-items-by-expiry-date-sortexpiry), [`sortpriority`](#523-sorting-food-items-by-priority-sortpriority)).

**Format:** `undo`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

**:exclamation: Warning:**<br>

Note that the undo/redo history will be cleared when you exit the application!

</div>

**Examples:**
* `delete 1` followed by `undo` will reverse the `delete` command.
* `delete 1` followed by `clear` then `undo` will reverse the `clear` command.

Steps:
1. Type `undo` in the _Command Box_.
2. Press `Enter` to execute.

Before the `undo` command is executed:

### 5.4.2. Redoing previously undone command: `redo`
_(Contributed by Boh Cheng Hin)_

The `redo` command restores your food inventory to a state before an [`undo`](#541-undoing-previous-command-undo) command was executed. This lets you easily redo commands that were incorrectly undone.

**Format:** `redo`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

**:exclamation: Warning:**<br>

Note that the undo/redo history will be cleared when you exit the application!

</div>

* `clear` followed by `undo` then `redo` will redo the `clear` command.

Steps:
1. Type `redo` in the _Command Box_.
2. Press `Enter` to execute.

Before the `redo` command is executed:

# 6. Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
_(Contributed by all members)_

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the application in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the data file in your previous SimplyKitchen home folder.

**Q**: What are the design and implementation considerations behind SimplyKitchen's code?<br>
**A**: You may find this information at our [Developer Guide](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html).

**Q**: How do I report a bug?<br>
**A**: You may do so by creating a new issue in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/issues).

**Q**: What does SimplyKitchen consider as a duplicate food item?<br>
**A**: In SimplyKitchen, two food items are duplicates if they have the same `description`, `expiry date` and `tags`. 
* All the `tags` must be the same.
* The capitalisation of the characters in the `description` or `tag` is ignored while checking for duplicates.
* The `priority` and `quantity` of food items are not considered while checking for duplicates.<br>

Figure 15 shows what the application will look like if you try to add a duplicate food item.
In this case, the `description`, `expiry date` and `tag` of the food item to be added is the same as the food item already inside the food inventory.
Therefore, the food item to be added is considered a duplicate.

# 5. Features
This section contains information on the features of SimplyKitchen and the respective commands that you can use.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Items with the format `lower_case/` refer to prefixes. They denote the different parameters.<br>
  Below are the relevant prefixes and their descriptions for the features.
 
  Prefix | Description
  -------|------------------
  `a/`   | Amount of a food item's quantity to change
  `d/`   | Description of a food item
  `e/`   | Expiry date of a food item
  `p/`   | Priority of a food item
  `q/`   | Quantity of a food item
  `t/`   | Tags to a food item

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` refer to information you have to provide.<br>
  e.g. In `add d/DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` refers to the food description you are adding, such as `add d/cucumber`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `d/DESCRIPTION e/EXPIRY_DATE [p/PRIORITY]` can be used as `d/bread e/30-09-2020` or as `d/bread e/30-09-2020 p/low`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. If the command specifies `d/DESCRIPTION e/EXPIRY_DATE`, `e/EXPIRY_DATE d/DESCRIPTION` is also acceptable.

* Ellipsis after a parameter indicates that multiple entries of that parameter can be given.<br>
  e.g. In `[t/TAG]...`, the command can have zero or more tags, as in `t/spicy t/mustard`.

* Parameters without ellipsis can only appear once.<br>
  e.g. `d/Apple Jam d/Apple Juice` and `p/low p/medium` are not allowed.

  e.g. The description parameter `d/    cashew  nuts   `, will be stored as `d/cashew  nuts`.

</div>

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#">^ Back to top</a></div>

## 5.1. Basic Commands
The commands in this section can be used to manipulate food items.

### 5.1.1. Adding a food item

The `add` command stores a food item in your food inventory, so that you can start tracking it.
You can then access the food item later on for editing, deleting etc.

**Format:** `add d/DESCRIPTION e/EXPIRY_DATE q/QUANTITY [p/PRIORITY] [t/TAG]â€¦`

* A food item with the same description, expiry date and tags as another food item is considered a duplicate.
* Description cannot contain more than 50 characters, including spaces.
* A tag cannot contain more than 72 characters, including spaces.
* Description and tags are case-insensitive (i.e `d/Apple e/30-12-2020 q/1 t/Red` is the same item as `d/apple e/30-12-2020 q/2 t/red`).
* The expiry date field only accepts a date in the format of `DD-MM-YYYY` or `DD/MM/YYYY`. The year must be between 2020 and 2120, both inclusive.
* The quantity field consists of 2 entities - `value` and `unit`. The `value` should come before the `unit`.
  * The `value` is compulsory. It must be a positive number with a maximum of 2 decimal places. The maximum value allowed is 100,000.00.
  * The `unit` is optional. If provided, it must consist of only alphabets. Numbers, spaces and special characters are not allowed. If not provided, the default unit - `unit` - will be given.
    The maximum length of the quantity unit is 20 characters.
* The priority field can either be `high`, `medium` or `low` and is optional. If a priority is not specified, the default priority will be set to `low`.
* The tag field accepts `alphanumeric`, `whitespaces` and these special characters: `#$%&-()`.
  * Tags with only whitespace(s) are not allowed.
  * A food item can have any number of tags (including 0).

**Examples:**
* `add d/Canned tuna e/01-01-2021 q/1.5 can p/low` adds an item having description `Canned Tuna`, expiry date `01-01-2021`, quantity `1.50 can` and priority `LOW`.
* `add d/Apple pie e/11-11-2020 q/2 p/medium t/frozen t/$15 t/contains nuts` adds an item having description `Apple pie`, expiry date `11-11-2020`, quantity `2.00 unit`, priority `MEDIUM`, and tags `frozen`, `$15` and `contains nuts`.
  The result of executing this example command is shown in the screenshot below.

  ![result for 'add d/Apple pie e/11-11-2020 q/2 p/medium t/frozen t/$15 t/contains nuts'](images/Add.png)

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#">^ Back to top</a></div>

### 5.1.2. Editing a food item

The edit command edits the details of an existing food item in your food inventory.
If an entry is incorrect, you can easily edit the entry without deleting and re-adding the food item.

**Format:** `edit INDEX [d/DESCRIPTION] [e/EXPIRY_DATE] [q/QUANTITY] [p/PRIORITY] [t/TAG]...`

* It edits the food item at the specified `INDEX`.
  * The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed food list.
  * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, â€¦
* You must specify at least one parameter (other than the `INDEX`) for this command to be valid.
* Existing values will be replaced with the values you input.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the food item will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
  * You can remove all the tags of a food item by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* Similar to the [add](#511-adding-a-food-item) command, a food item with the same description, expiry date and tags as another food item is considered a duplicate.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note about the parameters:**<br>

The constraints for the individual parameters of this command (description, expiry date, quantity, priority and tags) are the same as those for the [`add`](#adding-a-food-item) command.

</div>

**Examples:**
* `edit 1 d/baked beans e/1-1-2020` edits the food description and expiry date of the 1st food item to be `baked beans` and `01-01-2020` respectively.
* `edit 2 d/canned tuna q/0.5 can t/` edits the food description of the 2nd food item to be `canned tuna`, quantity to `0.50 can` and clears all existing tags.

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#">^ Back to top</a></div>

### 5.1.3. Deleting a food item

The `delete` command deletes a specified food item from your food inventory, so that you can stop tracking it.

**Format:** `delete INDEX`

* It deletes the food item at the specified `INDEX`.
  * The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed food list.
  * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, â€¦

**Examples:**
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd food item in your food inventory.
* `find d/tuna` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st food item from the result of the `find` command.

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#">^ Back to top</a></div>

### 5.1.4. Changing the quantity of a food item

The `changeqty` command changes the quantity of an existing food item in your food inventory without you having to calculate it yourself.
Use this command if you have bought new food items or used/discarded some existing food items.

**Format:** `changeqty INDEX a/AMOUNT`

* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed food list.
  * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, â€¦
* The amount is the quantity of a food item you want to change by.
  * The amount is a non-zero signed number with a maximum of 2 decimal places. It should be more than -100,000.00 and less than +100,000.00, but not zero.
  * Indicate a positive or negative sign before the value to show increment or decrement respectively.
  * Do not add a whitespace between the sign and the value. e.g. `+1` is acceptable but not `+ 1`.
* Do not specify the unit of the food item. The existing unit will be used instead.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Constraint on the size of amount:**<br>

Choose an amount such that the **final** quantity of the food item is not less than or equal to zero, or more than 100,000.

For example, you have already added 5 grams of flour in your food inventory with the [`add`](#511-adding-a-food-item) command.
You can use the `changeqty` command to add 0.01 to 99,995.00 grams of flour or subtract 0.01 to 4.99 grams of flour.
If you have used up all the flour, use the [`delete`](#513-deleting-a-food-item) command instead.

</div>

**Examples:**
* `list` followed by `changeqty 1 a/+1` increases the quantity of the 1st food item in your food inventory by 1.
* `find d/tuna` followed by `changeqty 2 a/-2.50` decreases the quantity of the 2nd food item from the result of the `find` command by 2.50.

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#">^ Back to top</a></div>

## 5.2. Sorting Commands
The commands in this section can be used to sort the food list. Before the list of food items is sorted for the first time, it will be ordered by `description` by default. 
Refer to [`5.2.1. Sorting food items by description`](#521-sorting-food-items-by-description) for a detailed explanation of sorting by description.

### 5.2.1. Sorting food items by description

The `sortdesc` command sorts the list of food items by description, allowing you to view your food items by description.

**Format:** `sortdesc`

* Sorting by description consists of first sorting lexicographically, then comparing the descriptions' first characters.
* If the first characters of two food item's descriptions are the same letters (i.e. `apple` and `Apricot`), 
descriptions with upper case first characters will be ordered lower compared to descriptions with lower case first characters.
* Food items of the same description will be sorted by expiry date from oldest to newest.
* Food items of the same description and same expiry date will be sorted by priority from high to low.

**Examples:**
* A possible valid ordering of descriptions would be: `apple`, then `apricot`, then `Acorn`.

  ![sorting by description](images/SortDesc.png)

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#">^ Back to top</a></div>

### 5.2.2. Sorting food items by expiry date

The `sortexpiry` command sorts the list of food items by expiry date from oldest to newest. With this, you can easily tell which food items are expiring first.

**Format:** `sortexpiry`

* Food items of the same expiry date will be sorted by priority from high to low.
* Food items of the same expiry date and same priority will be sorted by description.

  ![sorting by expiry date from oldest to newest](images/SortExpiry.png)

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#">^ Back to top</a></div>

### 5.2.3. Sorting food items by priority

The `sortpriority` command sorts the list of food items by priority from high to low. With this, you can easily tell which food items have higher priority.

**Format:** `sortpriority`

* If two food items have the same priority, they will be ordered by expiry date from oldest to newest.
* If two food items have the same priority and expiry date, they will be ordered by description.

![sorting by priority from HIGH to LOW](images/SortPriority.png)

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#">^ Back to top</a></div>

## 5.3. Viewing Commands
The commands in this section can used to list different types of food items.

### 5.3.1. Listing all food items

The `list` command shows the complete list of food items in your food inventory.
This command is suitable if you want to get a glimpse of all your food items currently in your kitchen.

**Format:** `list`

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#">^ Back to top</a></div>

### 5.3.2. Finding food items

The `find` command searches for food items in your food inventory and displays the result on your food list. You can easily find a specific food item, or a group of food items.
The search will return food items with matching description, priority, expiry date and tags (i.e `[d/DESCRIPTION OR [MORE_DESCRIPTIONS]...] AND [p/PRIORITY] AND [e/EXPIRY DATE] AND [t/TAG] OR ...`).

**Format:** `find [d/DESCRIPTION [MORE_DESCRIPTIONS]...] [e/EXPIRY DATE] [p/PRIORITY] [t/TAG]...`

* You must specify at least one parameter for this command to be valid.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `fish` will match `Fish`.
* Only full words in description will be matched. e.g. `fis` will not match `fish`.
* Food items with description matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e `OR` search). e.g. `fish` will return `Fish Cake`, `Tuna Fish`.
* The expiry date field only accepts a date in the format of `DD-MM-YYYY` or `DD/MM/YYYY`. The year must be between 2020 and 2120, both inclusive.
* The priority field can either be `high`, `medium` or `low`.
* The tag field accepts `alphanumeric`, `whitespaces` and these special characters: `#$%&-()`.
  * Tags with only whitespace(s) are not allowed.
  * Only full tags will be matched e.g. `nuts` will not match `contains nuts`.
  * Food items with tags matching at least one of the search tags will be returned (i.e `OR` search). e.g. `frozen` will return all food items with tags `frozen` regardless of their other tags.
* The description and tag can contain a maximum of 50 and 72 characters respectively.

**Examples:**
* `find d/chocolate` returns `Chocolate Pie` and `Chocolate Cake`.
* `find d/apple tuna` returns `Apple Pie` and `Tuna Can`.
* `find e/30-12-2020` returns all food items with expiry date on `30-12-2020`.
* `find d/apple p/high` returns `Apple Pie` and `Apple Jam`, both items have `HIGH` priority.
* `find t/cat t/dog` returns all food items with the tag `cat` or `dog`.
* `find d/biscuits p/medium e/30-12-2020 t/cat t/dog` returns food items with `biscuits` in the description, `MEDIUM` priority, expires on `30-12-2020` and have either `cat` or `dog` as tags.

### 5.3.3. Viewing expired food items

When you launch the application, it checks for any expired food items present in your food inventory. This lets you easily see what food items have expired.
If there is any expired food item, a pop-up window similar to the one shown below will appear with the list of expired food item(s).
If you have discarded the expired food item, please remember to delete the associated food item from the application using the [`delete`](#deleting-a-food-item) command.

If you want to see the list of expired food items when using the application, you can use the `expired` command.

**Q**: What does SimplyKitchen consider as a duplicate food item?<br>
**A**: In SimplyKitchen, two food items are duplicates if they have the same `description`, `expiry date` and `tags`. 
All the tags must be the same.
The capitalisation of the characters in the description or tag is ignored while checking for duplicates.
The `priority` and `quantity` of food items is not considered while checking for duplicates.<br>
The following screenshot gives an example of the error generated when trying to add a duplicate food item.<br>
The descriptions, expiry dates and tags are all the same. <br>
Notice the difference in case of the description `Apple pie` and tag `contains nuts`.
Whether the `priority` and the `quantity` are same or different is not considered.
